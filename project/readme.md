# Project SfM David Nordstr√∂m

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use [RoMa](https://github.com/Parskatt/RoMa) you must have PyTorch installed and I recommend a NVIDIA GPU. For further details I refer to the official [RoMa repo](https://github.com/Parskatt/RoMa)

## Run SfM

Run 

```bash
python3 run_sfm --dataset x
```

Where `x` corresponds to the dataset to which you want to apply the SfM pipeline.
